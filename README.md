## **Project: US Census Data Cleaning and Analysis**

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing raw census data. The goal of this project is to demonstrate a proficiency in using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to automate a data workflow that is typically manual and inefficient.

The project addresses the challenges of working with unstructured data spread across multiple files. The code shows how to take messy data and turn it into a clean, single dataset ready for powerful analysis and visualization.

### **Key Features & Skills Demonstrated:**

* **Data Ingestion**: Programmatically reading and combining multiple CSV files into a single, cohesive pandas DataFrame.
* **Data Cleaning**: Performing essential data transformations, including:
    * Converting string data with special characters (`$` and `%`) into numerical types.
    * Splitting and restructuring columns for better analysis (e.g., separating gender population data).
    * Identifying and removing duplicate data to ensure accuracy.
    * Strategically handling missing values by filling them with calculated data.
* **Data Visualization**: Creating informative graphs to quickly reveal trends and patterns in the cleaned data. The project includes examples of:
    * A **scatterplot** to explore the relationship between state income and gender demographics.
    * **Histograms** to visualize the distribution of different racial percentages across states.

This project serves as a practical example of how Python can be used to streamline and automate a full data analysis pipeline, providing a scalable and repeatable solution.
